# DataChallenge

The purpose of this Data challenge is to predict whether a DNA sequence of the vocabulary {A,C,T,G} is binding site to a specific transcription factor or not. It's requested to implement machine learning algorithms based on kernel methods. For this purpose, a set of kernels for sequence classification were implemented and tested, using kernelized learning algorithms such as support vector machine. The results on the training and test sets were encouraging, indeed, we had an accuracy and recall of 0.99 on training set and  0.71066 (9th rank) on the public leaderboard and 0.69866 (9th rank) on the private leaderboard.
